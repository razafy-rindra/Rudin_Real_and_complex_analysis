\section{Differentiation}
\subsection{Derivatives of Measures}
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $\mu$ is a complex Borel measure on $\R^1$ and \begin{equation}
        f(x) = \mu((-\infty, x)) \text{ for }x\in \R^1
    \end{equation}

    If $x\in \R^1$ and $A$ is a complex number, TFAE\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f'(x) = A$.
        \item For all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that\begin{equation}
            |\frac{\mu(I)}{m(I)}-A|<\epsilon
        \end{equation}

        for every open segment $I$ that contains $x$ and whose length is less than $\delta$. Note $m$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\R^1$.
    \end{enumerate}

    % \begin{proof}
    %     $(a)\Rightarrow (b)$         
    %     Since $f'(x) = A$, we have, for all $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for $(t,x)$ with $|t-x|<\delta$:\begin{align*}
    %         |\frac{f(t)-f(x)}{t-x} - f'(x)| &= |\frac{\mu([t,x))}{t-x} - A| = |\frac{\mu([t,x))}{m([t,x))} - A| <\epsilon \tag{$\dagger$}
    %     \end{align*}

    %     So for $I = (a,b)$ is any open interval containg $x$, of length less than $\delta$. Now let $\{t_n\}$ be such that $a<\ldots<t_n<t_{n-1}<\ldots < t_1$.
    % \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    Let us fix a dimension $k$, denote the open ball with center $x\in \R^k$ and radius $r>0$ by \[B(x,r) = \{y\in \R^k \colon |y-x|<r\}\]
    We associate to any Borel measure $\mu$ on $\R^k$ the quotients:\[({Q_r}\mu)(x) = \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))}\]
    Where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure on $R^k$.

    \

    We define the \textbf{symmetric derivative}\index{symmetric derivative} to be \[(D\mu)(x) = \lim_{r\rightarrow 0}({Q_r}\mu)(x)\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Using the same notation as above we define the \textbf{maximal function}\index{maximal function} $M\mu$, for $\mu\geq 0$, to be defined by \[(M\mu)(x) = \sup_{0<r<\infty}(Q_r\mu)(x)\]
\begin{remark}
    The maximal function of a complex Borel measure $\mu$ is, by definition, its total variation $|\mu|$.
\end{remark}
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    The functions $M\mu\colon R^k\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ are lower semicontinuous, hence measurable.
    \begin{proof}
        Assume $\mu\geq 0$, and let $\lambda>0$ and $E = \{M\mu > \lambda\}$. Fix $x\in E$. Then there is an $r>0$ such that:\[\mu(B(x,r)) = tm(B(x,r)) \text{ for some }t>\lambda\]

        Indeed since $\sup_{0<r<\infty}\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))} >\lambda$. So for some $r$, we have $\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))} >\lambda$. Letting $t = \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))}$ gives us the desired result. 
   
        Furthermore there is a $\delta>0$ such that:\[(r+\delta)^k<\frac{{r^k}t}{\lambda}\]
    If $|y-x|<\delta$, then $B(y,r+\delta) \supseteq B(x,r)$. Therefore
    \[
        \mu(B(y,r+\delta)) \geq \mu(B(x,r)) = tm(B(x,r)) = t[\frac{r}{{(r+\delta)}^k}m(B(y,r+\delta)) > \lambda m(B(y,r+\delta))]   
    \]
    Thus $B(x,\delta)\subseteq E$. So $E$ is open.
    \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}\label{7.3}
    If $W$ is the union of a finite collection of balls $B(x_i,r_i)$, with $i\leq i \leq N$. Then there is a set $S\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ so that:\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item the balls $B(x_i,r_i)$ with $i\in S$ are disjoint,
        \item \[W\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in S}B(x_i,3r_i),\]
        \item \[m(W)\leq 3^k\sum_{i\in S}m(B(x_i,r)i).\]
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{proof}
        Order the balls $B_i = B(x_i,r_i)$ such that $r_1\geq r_2\geq \cdots \geq r_N$. Put $i_1 = 1$, discard all the $B_j$ that intersect with $B_{i_1}$. Let $B_{i_2}$ the first of our remaining balls, and discard all $B_j$ with $j>i_2$ that intersect $B_{i_2}$, and let $B_{i_3}$ be the first of the remaining ones, etc\dots

        This process stops after a finite number of steps, since we only have a finite collection of balls, and we let $S = \{i_1,i_2,\ldots\}$.
    $(a)$ holds by definition and $(c)$ follows from $(b)$ since $m(B(x_i,3r_i)) = {3^k}m(B(x_i,r_i))$.

    So we just need to show $(b)$. But notice for every discarded $B_j$, $B_j\cap B_i\neq \emptyset$ for some $i\in S$, where $r_i>r_j$. Assume that $X\in B_j\cap B_i$. We see that for all $x\in B_j$ we have:\begin{align*}
        |x-x_i| &\leq |x-X| + |X-x_i|\\
                &\leq |x-x_j| + |x_j-X| + |X-x_i|\\
                &< r_j + r_j + r_i \text{ since }x,X\in B_j\text{ and }X\in B_i\\
                &< 3r_i \text{ since }r_j\leq r_i
    \end{align*}
    So we see that $B_j\subseteq B(x_i,3r_i)$. This gives us $(b)$.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\paragraph*{The maximal theorem}\begin{theorem}\label{maximal}
    If $\mu$ is a complex Borel measure on $\R^k$ and $\lambda$ is a positive number, then\[m\{M\mu > \lambda\}\leq 3^k\lambda^{-1}||\mu|| \tag{i} \]
    Here $||\mu|| = |\mu|(\R^k)$ and $m\{M\mu > \lambda\}$ is an abbreviation of $m(\{x\in \R^k\colon (M\mu)(x) > \lambda\})$
\begin{proof}
    Fix $\mu$ and $\lambda$. Let $K$ be a compact subset of the open set $\{M\mu >\lambda\}$. Each $x\in K$ is the center of an open ball $B$ for which 
    \[|\mu|(B)>\lambda m(B)\]

    Some finite collection of these $B$'s covers $K$ and Lemma~\ref{7.3} tells us there is a disjoint subcollection $\{B_1,\ldots,B_n\}$ such that:\begin{equation*}
        m(K)\leq 3^k\sum_{1}^n m(B_i)\leq 3^k\lambda^{-1}\sum_{1}^n|\mu|(B_i) \leq 3^l\lambda^{-1}||\mu||
    \end{equation*}
    The disjointess of the $B_i$'s was used in the last inequality. So (i) follows by taking the supremum over all compact $K\subseteq \{M\mu > \lambda\}$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
\paragraph*{Weak $L^1$}
If $f\in L^1(\R^k)$ and $\lambda >0$, then \[m\{|f|>\lambda\}\leq \lambda^{-1}||f||_1\]
because, if we let $E = \{|f|>\lambda\}$, we have:\begin{equation*}
    \lambda m(E)\leq \int_R |f|dm\leq \int_{\R^k}|f| dm = ||f||_1
\end{equation*}
\begin{definition}
    Any measurable function $f$ for which:\[\lambda m\{|f|>\lambda\}\]
    is a bounnded funtion of $\lambda$ on $(0,\infty)$ is said to belong to \textbf{weak}\index{weak} $L^1$\index{weak $L^1$}
 \end{definition}
So from above we see that the weak $L^1$ contains $L^1$. But it is also larger since for example if we let $f = \frac{1}{x}$ on $(0,1)$, then for any $\lambda>0$, we have
\[
    \frac{1}{x}>\lambda\iff x<\frac{1}{\lambda}    
\]

So we have $\lambda\cdot m\{|f|>\lambda\} \leq \lambda\cdot m(0,\frac{1}{\lambda}) = 1<\infty$. So $\frac{1}{x}$ is weak $L^1$.
\begin{definition}
    We associate to each $f\in L^1(\R^k)$ its \textbf{maximal function}\index{maximal function} $Mf\colon \R^k\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ by setting\begin{equation*}
        (Mf)(x) = \sup_{0<r<\infty}\frac{1}{m(B_r)}\int_{B(x,r)}|f|~dm
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
If we identify $f$ with the measure $\mu$ given by $d\mu = f~dm$, we see that this defintion agrees with the previously defined $M\mu$. So theorem~\ref{maximal} states that the ``maximal operator'' $M$ sends $L^1$ to weak $L^1$, witha bound (namely $3^k$)
that depends only on the space $\R^k$, i.e: For every $f\in L^1(\R^k)$ and every $\lambda>0$\begin{equation*}
    m\{Mf>\lambda\} \leq 3^k\lambda^{-1}||f||_1
\end{equation*}

\paragraph*{Lebesgue points} 
\begin{definition}
    If $f\in L^1(\R^k)$, any $x\in \R^k$ for which it is true that\[\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{m(B_r)}\int_{B(x,r)} |f(y)-f(x)|~dm(y) = 0\]
    is called a \textbf{Lebesgue point}\index{Lebesgue point} of $f$.
\end{definition}
For example this equation holds if $f$ is continuous at the point $x$. More generally this equation holds, if the averages of $|f-f(x)|$ are not too small on the balls centered at $x$, i.e. The Lebesgue points of $f$ are thepoints where $f$ doesn't oscillate too much.

\begin{theorem}
    If $f\in L^1(R^k)$, then almost every $x\in \R^k$ is a Lebesgue point of $f$.
\begin{proof}
    Let \[(T,f)(x) = \frac{1}{m(B_r)}\int_{B(x,r)} |f-f(x)|dm \text{ for }x\in \R^k, r>0\]

    Put \[(Tf)(x) = \limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}(T_r f)(x)\]

    Pick $y>0$, let $n\in \N^\ast$. By a theorem from chap $3$, there exists $g\in C(\R^k)$ so that $||f-g||_1 < \frac{1}{n}$. Let $h = f-g$.

    Since $g$ is continuous, $Tg = 0$, and since:\begin{align*}
        (T_r h)(x)&=\frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)} |h-h(x)|dm\\
        &\leq \frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)} (|h|+|h(x)|)dm\\
        &=(\frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)} |h|dm)+|h(x)|
    \end{align*}
    So we have:\[Th\leq Mh+|h|\]
    But since $T_r f\leq T_r g+T_r h$ it follows that\[Tf\leq Mh+|h|\]
    Therefore \[\{Tf>2y\} \subseteq \underbrace{\{Mh>y\}\cup\{|h|>y\}}_{E(y,n)}\]

    Since $||h||_1<\frac{1}{n}$, by theorem~\ref{maximal} we can see that\[m(E(y,n))\leq \frac{3^k+1}{yn}\]

    Note $\{Tf>2y\}$ is independant of $n$. Hence\[\{Tf>2y\} \subseteq \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E(y,n)\]

    This intersection has measure zero, so $\{Tf>2y\}$ is a subset of a set of measure zero. 
    So since Lebesgue measure is complete $\{Tf>2y\}$ is measurable and has measure zero. This is true for all $y>0$ so $Tf = 0$ a.e.

    So note if $(Tf)(x) = \limsup_{r\rightarrow 0} (T_r f)(x) = 0$, then since $(T_r f)(x)\geq 0$ we see that this means that $0\leq \liminf (T_r f)(x) \leq \limsup (T_r f)(x) =0$.
    
    So we have $\lim_{r\rightarrow 0} (T_r f)$ exists and is equal to zero, so $x$ is a Lebesgue point. So almost every point $x\in \R^k$ is a Lebesgue point of $f$. 
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
    Recall that by the Radon-Nikodym theorem if $\mu$ is a positive $\sigma$-finite measure on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ in a set $X$, and $\lambda$ is a complex measure on $\mathcal{M}$ such that $\lambda\ll \mu$:\[\lambda(E) = \int_E f d\mu \] For some $f\in L^1(\mu)$

    $f$ is called the \textbf{Radon-Nikodym derivative}of $\mu$ with respect to $m$\index{Radon-Nikodym derivative} and is denoted \[f = \frac{d\lambda}{d\mu}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{derivative}
    Suppose $\mu$ is a complex Borel measure on $\R^k$, and $\mu \ll m$. Let $f$ be the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $m$. Then $D\mu = f$ a.e. $[m]$, and
    \[\mu(E) = \int_E(D\mu)~dm\] for all Borel sets $E\subseteq \R^k$.
    \begin{proof}
        \[\mu(E) = \int_E f~dm\] For all Borel sets $E\subseteq \R^k$.

        Let $x$ be a Lebesgue point and $\Gamma_r = \frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)}f~dm$. Then we have:\begin{equation*}
            0\leq |\Gamma_r - f(x)| = |\frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)}(f-f(x))~dm| \leq \frac{1}{B_r}\int_{B(x,r)}|f-f(x)|~dm
        \end{equation*}

        Taking limits we see that \[f(x) = \lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{m(B_r)}\underbrace{\int_{B(x,r)}f~dm}_{\mu(B(x,r))} = \lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B_r)} = (D\mu)(x) \]
    
        Thus $(D\mu)(x)$ exists and equals to $f(x)$ at every Lebesgue point of $f$, so a.e.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\paragraph*{Nicely shirinking sets}
\begin{definition}
    Suppose $x\in \R^k$. A sequence $\{E_i\}$ of Borel sets in $\R^k$ is said to \textbf{shrink to }$x$\textbf{ nicely}\index{shrink to $x$ nicely} if there is a number $\alpha>0$ with the following property:\begin{center}
        There is a sequence of balls $B(x,r_i)$ with $\lim r_i = 0$, such that $E_i\subseteq B(x,r_i)$ and:\[m(E_i) \geq \alpha m(B(x,r_i)) \ \text{ for }i=1,2,3,\ldots \]
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Associate to each $x\in \R^k$ a sequence $\{E_i(x)\}$ that shrinks to $x$ nicely, and let $f\in L^1(\R^k)$. Then \[f(x) = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{m(E_i(x))}\int_{E_i(x)} f~dm \]
    At every Lebesgue point of $f$.

    \begin{proof}
        Let $x$ be a Lebesgue point of $f$ and let $\alpha(x)$ and $B(x,r_i)$ be the positive number and the balls associate with $\{E_i(x)\}$. Since $E_i(x)\subseteq B(x,r_i)$ we have:
        \[\int_{E_i(x)}|f-f(x)|~dm \leq \int_{B(x,r_i)}|f-f(x)|~dm \]

        Furthermore, $\alpha m(B(x,r_i))\leq m(E_i) \iff \frac{\alpha}{m(E_i)}\leq \frac{1}{m(B(x,r_i))}$. Putting this all together we get:

        \[\frac{\alpha}{m(E_i)}\int_{E_i(x)}|f-f(x)|~dm \leq \frac{1}{m(B(x,r_i))}\int_{B(x,r_i)}|f-f(x)|~dm\]

        Since $x$ is a Lebesgue point RHS converges to $0$, so the LHS also converges to zero by squeeze.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    If $f\in L^1(\R^1)$ and \[F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f~dm, \text{ for }x\in \R\]
    then $F'(x) = f(x)$ at every Lebesgue point of $f$.

    \begin{proof}
        Let $x$ be a Lebesgue point, and $\{\delta_i\}$ be a sequence of positive numbers that converges to $0$. Letting $E_i(x) = [x,x+\delta_i]$, the previous theorem tells us that 
        \[f(x) = \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{\delta_i}\int_{x}^{x+\delta_i}f~dm = \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\delta_i}(\int_{-\infty}^{x+\delta_i} f~dm - \int_{-\infty}^x f~dm) = \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}\frac{F(x+\delta_i) - F(x)}{\delta_i} \]

        Since $\{\delta_i\}$ is any sequence of positive numbers converging to zero we have:\[f(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h}\]
        
        Likewise letting $G_i(x) = [x-\delta_i,x]$ we get \[f(x) = \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}\frac{F(x-\delta_i) - F(x)}{\delta_i} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0^-}\frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} \]
    

        So we have:\[f(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{F(x+h) - F(x)}{h} = F'(x) \text{ at every Lebesgue point of }f\]
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

\paragraph*{Metric density}
\begin{definition}
    Let $E$ be a Lebesgue measurable subset of $\R^k$. The \textbf{metric density}\index{metric density} of $E$ at a point $x\in \R^k$ is defined to be 
    \[
        \lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{m(E\cap B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))}    \text{ if this limit exists.}
    \]

    If we let $f$ be the characteristic function of $E$, and apply Theorem~\ref{derivative}, we see that the metric density of $E$ is $1$ at almost every point of $E$ and is $0$ at almost every point of $E^c$.

    Indeed let $x$ be a Lebesgue point if $\mu(B(x,r)) = \int_{B(x,r)} f~dm = m(E\cap B(x,r))$, it is clear that $\mu\ll m$ and so we have:\[
        \lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{m(E\cap B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))} = \lim_{r\rightarrow 0} \frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{m(B(x,r))} = (D\mu)(x) = f(x) = \begin{cases}
            1 \text{ if }x\in E\\
            0 \text{ if }x\not\in E
        \end{cases}
    \]
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}
    If $\epsilon>0$, there is no set $E\subseteq \R^1$ such that\[\epsilon < \frac{m(E\cap I)}{m(I)}<1-\epsilon\] For every segment $I$.
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\epsilon>0$ assume that that such a $E\subseteq \R^1$ exists. Let $x$ be a Lebesgue point, from what we have seen in the definition of metric density we know that there is a $R$ such that:\begin{align*}
            |\frac{m(E\cap (x-R,x+R))}{m(x-R,x+R)}-0| &< \epsilon \text{ if }x\not\in E\\
            |\frac{m(E\cap (x-R,x+R))}{m(x-R,x+R)}-1| &< \epsilon \text{ if }x\in E
        \end{align*}         
        I.e. \begin{align*}
            \frac{m(E\cap (x-R,x+R))}{m(x-R,x+R)} < \epsilon \text{ or } 1-\epsilon<\frac{m(E\cap (x-R,x+R))}{m(x-R,x+R)}
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}

We now look at differentiation of measures that are singular wrt $m$.
\begin{theorem}\label{singular}
    Associate to each $x\in \R^k$ a sequence $\{E_i(x)\}$ that shrinks to $x$ nicely. If $\mu$ is a complex Borel measure and $\mu \perp m$, then\[
        \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mu(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = 0 \text{ a.e. }[m]    
    \]

    \begin{proof}
        By the Jordan decomp theorem we just need to show that this is true with $\mu\geq 0$. In that case as we have seen in previous theorems:\[
            \frac{\alpha(x)\mu(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} \leq \frac{\mu(E_i(x))}{m(B(x,r_i))} \leq \frac{\mu(B(x,r_i))}{m(B(x,r_i))} 
        \] 

        So if we can show that $(D\mu)(x) = 0$ a.e. [m], we will prove the result by taking limits in the above inequality.

        \

        The upper derivative $\bar{D}\mu$ is defined by:\[
            (\bar{D}\mu)(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\bigg[\sup_{0<r<1/n}(Q_r\mu)(x)\bigg] \text{ for }x\in \R^k
        \]
        Is a Borel function. 

        \

        Choose $\lambda>0$ and $\epsilon>0$. Since $\mu \perp m$, $\mu$ is concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure $0$. The regularity of $\mu$ shows that there is a compact set $K$m with $m(K) = 0$, and $\mu(K)>||\mu||-\epsilon$.

        Define $\mu_1(E) = \mu(K\cap E)$, for any Borel set $E\subseteq \R^k$, and put $\mu_2 = \mu-\mu_1$. Then $||\mu_2||<\epsilon$, and for every $x$ outside $K$,\[
            (\bar{D}(\mu))(x) = (\bar{D}(\mu_2))(x) \leq (M\mu_2)(x).    
        \]
        Hence \[
            \{\bar{D}\mu>\lambda\}\subseteq K\cup \{M\mu_2>\lambda\},    
        \]
        And \[
            m\{\bar{D}\mu>\lambda\} \leq 3^k\lambda^{-1}||\mu_2||<3^k\lambda^{-1}\epsilon    
        \]

        Since this holds for all $\epsilon>0$ and $\lambda>0$, we find that $\bar{D}\mu = 0$ a.e. [m], so \[(D\mu)(x) = 0 \ a.e.[m]\]
        Which gives us our result.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    Suppose that to each $x\in \R^k$ is associated to some sequence $\{E_i(x)\}$ that shrinks to $x$ nicely, and that $\mu$ is a complex Borel measure on $\R^k$.
   Let $d\mu = f~dm+d\mu_s$ be the Lebesgue decomposition of $\mu$ wrt $m$. Then\[
        \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mu(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = f(x) \ a.e. [m] 
   \]
   In particular, $\mu\perp m$ if and only if $(D\mu)(x) = 0$ a.e. [m]
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\mu_a(E) = \int_E f~dm$, then recall that $\mu = \mu_a+\mu_s$, and \[\begin{cases}
            \mu_a\ll m\\
            \mu_s\perp m
        \end{cases}\]

        Then from theorem~\ref{derivative}
        \[
            \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu_a(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = f(x) \ a.e. [m]
        \]

        On the other hand from theorem~\ref{singular}
        \[
            \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu_s(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = 0 \ a.e. [m]
        \]

        So we have\[
            \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mu(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mu_a(E_i(x))+\mu_s(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu_a(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} + \lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu_s(E_i(x))}{m(E_i(x))} = f(x) \ a.e. [m]      
        \]

        (Indeed if we let $A,B$ be the sets where the first two equations fail, then our result fails on $A\cup B$, which is the union of two measure zero sets, and so is a measure zero set, so this equality is true almost everywhere).

\begin{theorem}
    If $\mu$ is a positive Borel measure on $\R^k$ and $\mu\perp m$, then\[
        (D\mu)(x) = \infty \ a.e. [\mu]    \tag{$\dagger$}
    \]

    \begin{proof}
        There is a Borel set $S\subseteq \R^k$ with $m(S) = 0$ and $\mu(\R^k\setminus S) = 0$, and there are open sets $V_j\supseteq S$ with $m(V_j)<\frac{1}{j}$, for $j=1,2,3,\ldots$

        For $N=1,2,3,\ldots$, let $E_N$ be the set of all $x\in S$ to which correspond radii $r_i = r_i(x)$, with $\lim r_i = 0$ such that \[
            \mu(B(x,r_i)) <  Nm(B(x,r_i)).  \tag{$\dagger\dagger$}
        \]
        Then $(\dagger)$ holds for all $s\in S\setminus \bigcup_N E_N$.

        \

        Fix $N$ and $j$, for the moment. Every $x\in E_N$ is in the center of a ball $B_x\subseteq V_j$, that satisfies ($\dagger\dagger$). Let $\beta_x$ be the open ball with center $x$ whose radius is $\frac{1}{3}$ of that of $B_x$. The union of the $\beta_x$ is an open set $W_{j,N}$ such that $E_N\subseteq W_{j,N}\subseteq V_j$
 
        \

        Let $K\subseteq W_{j,N}$ be compact. Finitely many $\beta_x$ cover $K$. Lemma~\ref*{7.3} shows that there is a finite set $F\subseteq E_N$ such that:\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
            \item $\{\beta_x\colon x\in F\}$ is a disjoint collection, and
            \item $K\subseteq \bigcup_{x\in F} B_x$
        \end{enumerate}

        Therefore \begin{align*}
            \mu(K) &\leq \sum_{x\in F}\mu(B_x)\\
                   &< N\sum_{x\in F} m(B_x)\\
                   &= 3^k N\sum_{x\in F}m(\beta_x)\\
                   &\leq 3^k Nm(V_j)\\
                   &<3^k N/j
        \end{align*}
        This is true for any compact subset of $W_{j,N}$, since $W_{j,N}$ is open furthermore $\mu$ is a positive Borel measure on $\R^k$, so it is regular, therefore we have:
        
        \[
            \mu(W_{j,N}) = \sup\{\mu(K) \colon K\subseteq W_{j,N}\text{ is compact }\} < 3^k N/j   
        \]

        Now let $\Omega_N = \bigcap_j W_{j,N}$, then $E_N\subseteq \Omega_N$, and $\Omega_N$ is a $G_\delta$ (so is measurable), and $\mu(\Omega_N) = 0$, and so:\[(D\mu)(x) = \infty \text{ for all }x\in S\setminus\bigcup_N\Omega_N\]
        
        Since $\bigcup_N\Omega_N$ is a set of measure zero, we have the desired result.
    \end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Let \[
        f(x) = \begin{cases}
            x^2\sin(x^{-2}) \text{ if }x\neq 0\\
            0 \text{ otherwise}
        \end{cases}    
    \]
    Then $f$ is differentiable at every point, but\[
        \int_0^1 |f'(t)|~dt =\infty    
    \]

    So $f'\not\in L^1$. But we still have:\[
        f(x) = \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\int_\epsilon^x f'(t)~dt = \int_0^x f'(t)~dt    
    \]

    \item Suppose $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, $f$ is differentiable at almost every point of $[a,b]$ and $f'\in L^1$ on $[a,b]$. Do these assumptions imply that $f(x) - f(a) = \int_a^x f'$
    
    \textsc{NO!}

    \

    Choose $\{\delta_n\}$ so that $1 = \delta_0>\delta_1>\cdots$, where $\delta_n\rightarrow 0$, we define the sets $E_n$ recursively. Put $E_0 = [0,1]$ and if $n\geq 0$ and $E_n$ is constructed so that it is the union of $2^n$ disjoint closed intervals, each of length $2^{-n}\delta_n$. 
    
    Delete a segment in the center of each of the $2^n$ intervals, so that each $2^{n+1}$ intervals have length $2^{-(n+1)}\delta_{n+1}$, and let $E_{n+1}$ be the union of these $2^{n+1}$ intervals. So we have $E_1\supseteq E_2\supseteq \ldots$, and $m(E_n) = \delta_n$ for all $n$. Now let\[
        E = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty E_n    
    \]

    Note since each $E_n$ is the finite union of closed sets, they are closed so $E$ is also closed, it is also bounded since it is contained in $[0,1]$. So $E$ is compact and $m(E) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}m(E_n) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\delta_n = 0$. Put \[
        g_n = \delta_n^{-1}\chi_{E_n} \text{ and } f_n(x) = \int_0^x g_n(t)~dt \text{ for }n=0,1,2,\ldots    
    \]

    So note $f_n(0) = 0$ and $f_n(1) = \delta_n^{-1}\int_0^1 \chi_{E_n} = \delta_n^{-1}m(E_n) = 1$. Each $f_n$ is a monotonic function which is constant on each segment in $E_n^c$.
    If $I$ is one of the $2^n$ interval whose union is $E_n$, then\[
        \int_I g_n(t)~dt = \int_I g_{n+1}(t)~dt = 2^{-n}.    
    \]

    Therefore we see that \[
        f_{n+1}(x) = f_n(x)  \text{ for }x\not\in E_n   
    \]

    Now note that \[
        |f_n(x) - f_{n+1}(x)|\leq \int_I |g_n-g_{n+1}|<2^{-(n-1)} \text{ for } x\in E_n    
    \]

    So $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformely to a continuous monotonic function $f$, with $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, and $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x\not\in E$. Since $m(E) = 0$, we see that $f' = 0$ almost everywhere. So\[
        f(x) \neq \int_0^x f' \text{ in general}    
    \]

    \begin{definition}\index{absolutely continuous}
        A complex function $f$, defined on an interval $I = [a,b]$ is said to be \textbf{absolutely continuous} on $I$ (or $f$ is AC on $I$) if for all $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that\[
            \sum_{i=1}^n|f(\beta_i)-f(\alpha_i)|<\epsilon    
        \]
        For all $n$m and any disjoint collection of segments $(\alpha_1,\beta_1),\ldots,(\alpha_n,\beta_n)$ in $I$ whose length satisfy\[
            \sum_{i=1}^n (\beta_i-\alpha_i)<\delta    
        \]
        \begin{remark}
            Such an $f$ is continuous since we can choose $n=1$.
